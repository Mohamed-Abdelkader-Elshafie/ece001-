<h3><p>Artificial Intelligence has various applications in today's society. It is becoming essential for today's time because it can solve complex problems with an efficient way in multiple industries, such as Healthcare, entertainment, finance, education, etc. AI is making our daily life more comfortable and fast.
Following are some sectors which have the application of Artificial Intelligence:</p>
<p>1. AI in Astronomy<br>
Artificial Intelligence can be very useful to solve complex universe problems. AI technology can be helpful for understanding the universe such as how it works, origin, etc.

<p>2. AI in Healthcare <br>
In the last, five to ten years, AI becoming more advantageous for the healthcare industry and going to have a significant impact on this industry.
