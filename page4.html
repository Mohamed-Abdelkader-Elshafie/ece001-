<h2> Two main types of Artificial Intelligence are following :</h2>
<ul><h2><li> Based on Capabilities</li> <li> on Functionality </li></h2>
</ul>
<h3><P>Artificial Intelligence Type-1 :  Based on Capabilities</P>
<p> Narrow OR Weak Artificial Intelligence :</p>
Narrow AI is a category of AI that is capable of performing a dedicated intelligence mission. The most popular and currently available AI is the Narrow AI in the Artificial Intelligence universe.Narrow AI cannot work outside its area or limits, since it is qualified for only one specific operation. It is also often referred to as weak AI. Narrow AI can fail in unexpected ways if it goes beyond its limits.Apple Siri is a clear example of Narrow AI, but it performs with a small predefined range of tasks. Watson supercomputer of IBM is also part of Narrow AI, since it uses an expert system approach paired with machine learning and natural language processing.Examples of Narrow AI include playing chess, buying e-commerce tips, self-driving vehicles, voice recognition, and face recognition.
<p>2. General Artificial Intelligence :<br>
General AI is a kind of intelligence that could execute any intellectual activity as effectively as a human individual.The concept behind General AI is to create a machine that will be smarter and think about itself as a human being There is currently no such device that could fall under the general AI and execute any role as fine as a human being. Global researchers are now focusing on the development of General AI machines.As programs with general AI are still undergoing testing, it will take hard work and time to improve those systems.
</p><p>3.Super Artificial Intelligence<br>Super AI is a level of system intelligence at which robots can transcend human consciousness and enter into a force better than humans with cognitive properties. This is the product of General AI.Any of the main characteristics of super AI are the ability to understand, analyze, solve a puzzle, make decisions, prepare, study and interact on its own.Super AI is also a theoretical term for Artificial Intelligence. The development of such technologies in real life continues to change the world’s mission.</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence Type- 2 :<br>  Based On Functionality<br>
   1. Reactive Machines
   These are the earliest types of AI systems of incredibly limited capacity. They mimic the capacity of the human mind to react to various kinds of stimuli.
    
    These computers have no memory-based capabilities. This means that those machines cannot use past knowledge to guide their present behavior, i.e. such machines do not have the capacity to “study.”
    
    These devices may only be used to automatically react to a small range or combination of inputs. They cannot be used to depend on memory to boost their operations on the same basis.
    
    A common example of a reactive AI system is IBM’s Deep Blue, a chess machine that hit Grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997.</p>
<p>2.Limited Memory <br>

    Limited memory devices can hold memories and experiences or data for a short period of time. These computers could only use encrypted data for a short amount of time.
    
    Self-driving vehicles are one of the earliest examples of limited memory devices. These cars will store up-to-date speeds of local cars, distances of other cars, speed limits, and other road traffic statistics.
    When a picture is scanned from such an AI, it uses testing images as guides to recognize the contents of the image shown to it, and on the basis of its “learning experience,” it identifies new images with increasing precision.

Almost all current AI implementations, from chatbots and virtual assistants to self-driving cars, are all powered by limited AI memory.
    </p>
    <p>3. Theory of Mind<br>

        While the prior 2 types of AI have been and are predominantly found, the next two types of AI still exist, either as an idea or as a work in progress.
        
         Mind Theory AI is the next phase of AI technologies now being used by researchers to innovate. Theory of mind  AI Theory would be able to better understand the people with which it interacts by discerning their desires, feelings, beliefs, and thought patterns.
        
        Though artificial emotional intelligence is already a development of a new system and a field of focus for leading AI researchers, achieving AI Theory of mind would entail advancement in other AI branches as well.
        
        That’s because, in order to fully comprehend human desires, AI robots would have to view people as entities whose minds can be formed by various influences, basically “acknowledgment” human beings.</p> 
        <p>4.Self-Awareness<br>
This is the final stage of the growth of AI, which actually occurs only in a conceptual way. Self-awareness AI, which, self-explanatorily, is an AI that has developed to be so similar to the human brain that it has established self-awareness.Generating this kind of AI, which is decades away from materialization, if not centuries away, is and will always be the ultimate goal of all AI science.</p>This kind of AI will not only be able to recognize and elicit emotions in those it communicates with, but will also have emotions, interests, values, and likely desires of its own. And this is the kind of AI that the technology scaremongers are suspicious of.While the growth of self-awareness can potentially improve our success as a society by advancements, it can also potentially lead to trouble. This is because, if self-aware, the AI would be able to get ideas like self-preservation that could directly or implicitly spell the destruction for civilization, as such a being could potentially overcome the intelligence of any human being and devise complex plans to take over mankindAI is one of the most exciting and universal realms of computer science in the future. AI has a desire to make a computer function as a human being.Artificial Intelligence occurs because a computer may provide human-based capabilities such as understanding, logic, and problem-solving. </h3>
